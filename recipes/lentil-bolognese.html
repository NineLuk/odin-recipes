        <h3>Classic lentil bolognese</h3>
        
        <p>Serve up this classic by replacing £4.50 worth of 500g minced beef with the exact same amount of lentils for just £1.35.</p>

        <p>For extra nutrition, you could also choose to add a handful of frozen vegetables <br> to your vegan spag bol - which you can find for as little as £1 or less per bag.</p>
