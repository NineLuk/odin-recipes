            <h3>A  Delicious vegan chilli made with cheap ingredients</h3>
            
            <p>You can make your own vegan chilli from scratch with cheap ingredients like canned tomatoes and kidney beans,<br> or you can even buy a can of mixed beans in chilli sauce from the supermarket for 80p.</p>
            
            <p>You could also add soya mince, which would cost you Â£2.50 less than if you were to opt for beef mince.</p>
